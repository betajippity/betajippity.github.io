Just a quick update on future plans. Starting in July, I'm going to be working full time for [Walt Disney Animation Studios](http://www.disneyanimation.com/) as a software engineer on their custom, in-house [Hyperion Renderer](http://www.fxguide.com/featured/disneys-new-production-renderer-hyperion-yes-disney/). I couldn't be more excited about working with everyone on the Hyperion team; ever since the [Sorted Deferred Shading paper](https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/publication_asset/70/asset/Sorted_Deferred_Shading_For_Production_Path_Tracing.pdf) was published two years ago, I've thought that the Hyperion team is doing some of the most interesting work there is in the rendering field right now.

I owe an enormous thanks to everyone that's advised and supported and encouraged me to continue exploring the rendering and graphics world. Thanks, Joe, Don, Peter, Tony, Mark, Christophe, Amy, Fran, Gabriel, Harmony, and everyone else!

Normally as a rule I only post images to this blog that I made or have a contribution to, but this time I'll make an exception. Here's one of my favorite stills from Big Hero 6, rendered entirely using Hyperion and lit by Angela McBride, a friend from PUPs 2011! Images like this one are an enormous source of inspiration to me, so I absolutely can't wait to get started at Disney and help generate more gorgeous imagery like this!
