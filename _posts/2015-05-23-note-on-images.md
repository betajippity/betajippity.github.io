Just a quick note on images on this blog. So far, I've generally been embedding full resolution, losslessly compressed PNG format images in the blog. I prefer having the full resolution, lossless images available on the blog since they are the exact output from my renderer. However, full resolution lossless PNGs can get fairly large (several MB for a single 1920x1080 frame), which is dragging down the load times for the blog.

Going forward, I'll be embedding lossy compressed JPG images in blog posts, but the JPGs will link through to the full resolution, lossless PNG originals. Fortunately, high quality JPG compression is quite good these days at fitting an image with nearly imperceptible compression differences into a much smaller footprint. I'll also be going back and applying this scheme to old posts too at some point.
