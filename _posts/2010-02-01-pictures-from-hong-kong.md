I took around 500 pictures while I was in Hong Kong over the summer, but I never really got around to sorting/processing those photos until this weekend. Obviously 500 is too great a sum for any sane person to want to look through here, so instead here are around 35 (give or take a few) shots that [Ana Kim](ana.omjii.com) helped me pick out.

Almost everything was shot with my Nikon D60; a few shots were taken with my dad's Sony DSC T-100.

Victoria Harbour from about the 30th floor of International Finance Centre Two. My dad's old college buddy is a director at Nomura's Hong Kong branch (they used to be Lehman Brothers, but Nomura bought them out around the time Lehman collapsed), this shot is from his office. The green hue of the photo is from the green tint of their windows.

The same shot as the one above, only with the green tint removed.

International Finance Centre Two from my dad's friend's office.

Another shot of Victoria Harbour from International Finance Centre Two.

Hong Kong's Central Business District, as seen from the edge of Victoria Harbour.

I couldn't decide between black/white and color, so both are here. A lot of these shots appear here in color and black/white because I'm bad at making up my mind.

All of the buildings in Hong Kong's Central Business District are connected by these elevated covered walkways.

One of the elevated walkways leading from International Finance Centre.

Hong Kong has a LOT of really high end stores. I found this one street corner where there was a giant Louis Vuitton store...

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0417-2.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0417-2.jpg)

...and not far from the Louis Vuitton store was a big Prada Store.

The previous shot of the Prada Shot has all colors desaturated except for yellow. This shot has all of the colors untouched.

I love experimenting with panoramas and stitching together separate shots into large shots. I thought I'd give stitching a shot in front of the HSBC and Bank of China towers.

I love the tubes and frame and stuff on the HSBC tower. Very very fun to look at.

One of the covered walkways had to have a suspension system because it's main span was so long. I think my exact reaction was something like "AWESOME!"

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0441-2.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0441-2.jpg)

A lot of people use these walkways.

I couldn't decide between color and black/white for that shot, so both versions are here.

I found this in some random record store! I really regret not buying it. 

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0444.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0444.jpg)

I wasn't expecting to find such grand boulevards in such a cramped city.

Another panorama that I stitched together. I think this was taken from in front of Hong Kong's main Convention Center (which juts out into Victoria Harbour). On the left is Hong Kong's Central Business District, on the left is Kowloon Island, which is starting to get more and more skyscrapers. The crazy clouds are what an incoming typhoon looks like.

Again, I couldn't pick between color and black/white, so here's both!

This is cropped from a larger panorama. The guy on the edge of the water with the umbrella is my dad.

Taxis in Hong Kong are red! They also drive on the wrong side of the road, just like in the UK.

The older parts of Hong Kong are AMAZING to visit, simply because there's so much to see.

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0502.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0502.jpg)

So many people, so many advertisements!

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0504.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0504.jpg)

The malls in Hong Kong make the ones back in the US look puny.

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0505-2.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0505-2.jpg)

There was some celebrity holding a press conference in this one mall. This guy was videotaping it.

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0505.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0505.jpg)

"Times Square" is an odd name for a mall.

Incredibly, this subway car can be considered relatively empty in Hong Kong. The subways get CRAZY packed during rush hour.

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0513.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0513.jpg)

HAIR POTATO!

Two random people caught in the downpour from the typhoon.

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0605.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0605.jpg)

Lantau Island has this mind-bending cable car system.

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC08383.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC08383.jpg)

This shot doesn't even look real.

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0615_stitch.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0615_stitch.jpg)

At the top of Victoria Peak, there's this big mall/tower called Peak Tower that offers amazing downward views of Hong Kong's Central Business District. A great place for panoramas!

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0618.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/DSC_0618.jpg)

That really tall blue tower that isn't the under construction one in the far background is International Finance Centre Two. Cool place.

At Dian's request, high res version available [here](http://www.omjii.com/karu/uploads/HongKong/DSC_0618.jpg).

Even the apartment buildings in Hong Kong are taller than most skyscrapers in Philadelphia.

The Hong Kong Convention Center has this crazy amazing rainbow light-up wall thing. I'm using this shot as my desktop wallpaper right now. If you want the full res gigantic file: click [here](http://www.omjii.com/karu/uploads/HongKong/DSC_0496-2.jpg).

The view down from my dad's friend's apartment. "Apartment" isn't really a good description... condo might be better? At any rate, it was a huge condo. I had this as my background for a while too. [Full res here](http://www.omjii.com/karu/uploads/HongKong/DSC_0335.JPG).

I'll post more pics from Shanghai and Beijing later, perhaps.
