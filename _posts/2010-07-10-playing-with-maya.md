I've been playing with Maya for the past few months. 3D animation is a direction I'd like to start moving in.

I'm starting to get the hang of lighting things and whatnot, although I still do not know much. I'm taking a 3D modeling course in the fall, hopefully I'll get much better by then.

Some glasses and strawberries and grapes on a table:
