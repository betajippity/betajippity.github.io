Here's the first progress summary/blog digest for the [GPU Pathtracer project](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/)!

Over the past few days, Peter and I established our framework, got random number generation working on the GPU, built an accumulator, figured out parallelized camera ray projection, got spherical intersection tests working, and got a basic path-traced image!

Here are the posts for this update:

1. [Random Number Generation](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/2012/04/random-number-generator.html): Fun with parallelized random number generators and seeding
2. [First Rays on the GPU](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/2012/03/first-rays-on-gpu.html): Parallel raycasting!
3. [Accumulating Iterations](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/2012/03/accumulating-iterations.html): The heart of any monte-carlo based renderer
4. [We Have Path Tracing](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/2012/03/we-have-path-tracing.html): First working renders!

Here's an image from our very first working render! More soon!
