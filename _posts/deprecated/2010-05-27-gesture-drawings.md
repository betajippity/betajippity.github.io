This summer, for the first time ever, I'm taking a hard core art class! By "hard core art class", I mean classes like Drawing or Painting or whatnot. Traditional art. Not that I have anything against photography or digital stuff (which I've already been exploring).

I'm not really sure how taking Drawing 1 this summer is going to work out, since I'm not particularly amazing at drawing. Hopefully I'll get better and better as I get more practice. So every week, I'll try to post as much stuff as I can from class to show how much I am (or am not) progressing.

On Monday we had class for the first time but didn't really do anything since we didn't have anything to draw on and with. By Tuesday though, we had all went to Blick Art Materials (amazing amazing place) and gotten sketchpads and drawing pads and pencils and charcoal and whatnot.

Our professor had us start with timed gesture drawings on Tuesday. The point was to learn how to recognize the basic forms of objects and stuff. Basically, we were given really short time spans ranging from 15 seconds to a few minutes to quickly sketch still life setups.

We started with a bike. This one was done in 15 seconds:

For this one, we did one gesture drawing in 15 seconds, then our professor had us rub out the drawing and do another one in 15 seconds.

We had 20 seconds for this one:

Then we drew a bear, again in 15 seconds:

Then we drew the bear again, rubbed it out, and redrew a third time, now in 30 seconds:

Things started getting interesting when we moved onto a more complex still life with a potted plant, an old rotary telephone, and a jar. We started with one minute:

Then we had two minutes:

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/May/DSC_0047.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/May/DSC_0047.jpg)

...and finally we had three minutes:

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/May/DSC_0046.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/May/DSC_0046.jpg)

Finally, we moved on to this gigantic still life with a ton of random stuff in the middle of the room on a platform. We had about ten minutes for this one:

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/May/DSC_0044.jpg)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/May/DSC_0044.jpg)

Overall, that was a pretty hard exercise. We were working in charcoal, which is way harder to use than I thought it would be, and the time limits made getting everything onto the paper pretty tough. That was interesting.
