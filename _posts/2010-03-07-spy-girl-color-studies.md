Here are some sketches (with color!) of Elaine the spy girl. The goal here wasn't to produce particularly good drawings, but rather, was to play with color.

Here she's in some cafe type place:

...and here she's some kind of modern looking place. I meant the location to be an airport, but [Sarah](yangee.tumblr.com) pointed out that it looks more like a modern office building place. Maybe it's spy headquarters! Kind of like NSS in [IRIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIS_%28TV_series%29).

Here is what the original black and white pencil sketches look like:

As a final note, I'm thinking about changing Elaine from being a spy girl to being something else. A spy concept definately seems fun to do, but this idea is veering a little too close to Kevin Dart's fantastic [Yuki 7](http://www.yuki-7.com/) project (to be honest, I used some of his stuff as reference to do that airport sketch). So we'll see where this goes.
