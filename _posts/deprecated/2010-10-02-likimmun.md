[Ana Kim](http://www.anajkim.com/), [Sarah Mun](http://yangee.tumblr.com/), and I are starting a joint daily photoblog! Each day all three of us upload a photo to the site. We're supposed to try to post recently taken photos, but tapping into our older shots is okay too as long as the shot being posted hasn't been published before. The site is running on a modified version of the [Omjii](http://www.omjii.com/) engine.

So every day, three photos by the three of us.

I'm really excited. Why don't you [take a look?](http://www.likimmun.com/)

Bonus: This is the photo we used for the [site teaser](http://www.likimmun.com/teaser.php):

It's one of my dad's old lenses.
