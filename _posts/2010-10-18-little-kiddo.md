I don't really have any idea yet of what kind of adventure she'll go on. I'll figure that out as I go along, I suppose. I picked a little kiddo mainly because I love how crazy exaggerated little kids often make their expressions. Just check out the absolutely beautifully animated short [Playing with light - Mon ami le robot](http://vimeo.com/15731659).

More later!
