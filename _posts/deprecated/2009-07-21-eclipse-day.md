Today Kevin, Justin, and I took a half day off from work so that we could go eclipse-watching in the morning. We had decided on the lake at Century Park near the international area as our eclipse-watching location.

Ryan and I woke up, however, to very bad news. The first thing I saw when I rolled out of bed was... gray thunderclouds as far as the eye could see. Not good.

We met with Kevin and Justin at Century Park, this big park near the international zone with a big lake. Perfect for eclipse viewing.... if there weren't any clouds...

CLOUDS:

Problem: the sun was only visible for brief seconds through the cloud layer:

Even bigger problem: I didn't have a tripod. Which meant I had to prop up my camera on a rock and try to aim it at the sun. We had found this rocky outcropping that jutted out into the lake, so we set up there.

Here's Kevin and Justin chilling on the outcropping:

I found a rock that worked pretty well as a tripod (Ryan agreed, he set up his video camera on the same rock). I figured that using the viewfinder of my camera to aim the camera at the sun would be okay if I did so during a moment when the sun was behind the clouds. So that's exactly what I did.... but the sun decided to come out right as I was in the middle of aiming. Needless to say, that hurt my eyes. Ouch.

But it was worth it! I got some pretty cool pictures:

And then the rain started... ten minutes before totality. Much scrambling to get laptops and cameras and other equipment under this rock cave thing ensued (Justin and I had laptops because we were going to work right after the eclipse). Here's Ryan sitting under a rock:

Totality hit pretty suddenly. The plan was for me to shoot pictures and Kevin and Ryan to shoot video, but totality hit us a little earlier than expected. Scrambling occurred again to get the video camera into Kevin's hands and the DSLR camera out from under the rocky cave:

Unfortunately, the cloud cover and rain meant that we didn't actually see totality... but we did experience the darkness of totality.

9:40 in the morning:

I had to use flash because everything got so dark.

Later, when we were leaving Century Park, something amazingly hilarious happened...

Justin had bought a Finding Nemo volleyball thing earlier for 3 RMB. On our way out of the park, Justin was hitting the ball around and... it landed in a pond between two bridges. This video should give you an idea of the hilarity that ensued:

This went on for like, 10 minutes. Eventually Justin gave up and we left the ball behind.

Later, we also found this:

A "Caution: Wet Floor" sign in the middle of a rainstorm. The sign is kind of stating the obvious, isn't it?

Overall, today made for one interesting day.
