I spent the Fourth of July weekend with my aunt and uncle and little cousin. :) Well, I call her my little cousin, because I always remember her as being little, but now she's like 12. Not so little anymore. Anyhoo, on Sunday I showed her around Pixar and then my aunt and uncle took us to the beach.

Here are some crappy doodles I made at the beach:

Yup. I am not good at drawing.

On a sidenote, I can't post any Pixar stuff now due to NDA, but I might be able to post a few project things at the end of the summer. We shall see.

More later!
