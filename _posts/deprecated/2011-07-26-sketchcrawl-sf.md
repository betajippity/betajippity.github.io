Last weekend I went to [Sketchcrawl 32](http://www.sketchcrawl.com/) with fellow Pixarians [Kendra Phillips](http://kendora.blogspot.com/), [Stewart Hills](http://vimeo.com/user2536161), [Aimei Kutt](http://aimeikutt.com), and [Jeff Gipson](http://vimeo.com/user7067226)! The basic idea behind Sketchcrawl is a bunch of artists gather, sketch all day, and then scatter. We sketched in and around San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square.

Some of my sketches:

I'm still not a very good drawer and I still have massive difficulties drawing people. :p But I think I'm improving.... more practice!

I was hoping that [Enrico Casarosa](http://www.enricocasarosa.com/wordpress.1/) would be there, but he couldn't make it to this one. I've only ever seen Enrico in the halls at work and at a screening of La Luna. I got to meet some really cool people from Dreamworks at Sketchcrawl, though. I met [Francesco Giroldini](http://giro3d.blogspot.com/) and [Lindsey Olivares](http://www.lindseyolivares.blogspot.com/)! You can see everybody's Sketchcrawl @ San Francisco stuff on the [official Sketchcrawl forums](http://www.sketchcrawl.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=57&t=6759).
