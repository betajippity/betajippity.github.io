A few weeks ago I joined a startup founded by a few Penn alums called [Venmo](http://www.venmo.com/)! My project at Venmo for the past few weeks has been helping my friend and co-worker, [Ayaka Nonaka](http://twitter.com/ayanonagon), with a new app from Venmo called [Gifi](http://www.givegifi.com/), which is a Foursquare/Venmo mashup that lets people leave Venmo money at geographic locations. I've been working on Gifi's [website](http://www.givegifi.com/) and overall look. Here's some of the artwork I did for Gifi:
