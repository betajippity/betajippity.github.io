Just a super quick update on my future plans:

Next year, starting in September, I'll be joining [Dr. Don Greenberg](http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/people/director.html) and [Dr. Joseph T. Kider](http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~kiderj/index.htm) and others at [Cornell's Program for Computer Graphics](http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/). I'll be pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Graphics there, and will most likely be working on something involving rendering (which I suppose is not surprising).

Between the end of school and September, I'll be spending the summer at [Pixar Animation Studios](http://www.pixar.com/) once again, this time as part of [Pixar's Research Group](http://graphics.pixar.com/research/people.html).

Obviously I'm quite excited by all of this!

Now, back to working on my renderer.
