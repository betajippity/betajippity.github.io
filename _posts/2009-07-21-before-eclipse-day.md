I'm in Shanghai, and tomorrow a full solar eclipse is going to occur over Shanghai!

My friend Ryan Lin from high school arrived at my place tonight. He's in Shanghai specifically for the eclipse tomorrow. Ryan is working on a new comic that's going to launch soon, but more details on that in the future.

Ryan's a cool guy. He brought us eclipse glasses.

Quick science lesson: looking at a solar eclipse with your naked eyeballs is really dangerous. Normally when we look at the sun, the brightness of the sun forces us to turn away almost immediately, minimizing the risk for permanent eye damage in the process. During an eclipse though, the sun does not appear as bright, which means when we can stare at the sun longer without averting our eyes. Which is really really bad for us. During a solar eclipse, the part of the sun that shoots our UV that fries our eyeballs is just as active as ever even though the sun's overall brightness appears to drop. Because of this, viewing the sun during a solar eclipse must be done with special eclipse glasses with filter lenses to avoid permanent eye damage. The only exception to this rule is during totality.

So these glasses things are REALLY good at blocking out light, which makes sense since they need to block out everything but the faintest hint of light from the sun. When I first put them on, I couldn't see anything. Squat. Zilch. Ryan said the only thing that he had managed to see through the goggles was the filament of a really really bright incandescent light bulb at his home, but we don't have any of those lights in our apartment.

The glasses have all these warnings and instructions on the inside. Cool stuff.

Eventually I did manage to see something through the glasses... although not exactly in a good way. I figured "Hey, my Nikon D60 has a really powerful flash unit, so if anything in this apartment is going to be able to push light through these glasses, the flash unit is a good bet." So I proceeded to fire off the flash unit about an inch away from the glasses' filter lenses.

Bad idea. Very bad idea. I saw the flash through the filter lenses, but I had forgotten that the flash unit generates a lot of heat. Enough heat to melt through eclipse glasses filter lenses. Which is exactly what happened. Uh oh.

The glasses have a warning printed on them that says something to the effect of "Discard immediately if lenses are damaged of punctured." That's not an option here, because Ryan didn't have any extra pairs. He didn't count on my stupidity.

The solution: patch up the damaged lens with material that we know will block ALL light. This way I can at least use the one remaining good lens.

Eclipse day is tomorrow. Time to sleep.
