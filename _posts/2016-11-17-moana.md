This year is the first year ever that [Walt Disney Animation Studios](http://www.disneyanimation.com/) is releasing two CG animated films. We released [Zootopia](http://www.disneyanimation.com/projects/moanaopia) back in March, and next week, we will be releasing our newest film, [Moana](http://www.disneyanimation.com/projects/moana). I've spent the bulk of the last year and a half working as part of Disney's [Hyperion Renderer](http://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/innovations/hyperion) team on a long list of improvements and new features for Moana. Moana is the first film I have an official credit on, and I couldn't be more excited for the world to see what we have made!

We're all incredibly proud of Moana; the story is fantastic, the characters are fresh and deep and incredibly appealing, and the music is an instant classic. Most important for a rendering guy though, I think Moana is flat out the best looking animated film anyone has ever made. Every single department on this film really outdid themselves. The technology that we had to develop for this film was staggering; we have a whole new distributed fluid simulation package for the endless oceans in the film, we added advanced new lighting capabilities to Hyperion that have never been used in an animated film before to this extent (to the best of my knowledge), we made huge advances in our animation technology for characters such as Maui; the list goes on and on and on. Something like over 85% of the shots in this movie have significant FX work in them, which is unheard of for animated features. We are going to have a lot to show at the next SIGGRAPH conference.

The first section of the credits sequence in Moana showcases a number of the props that our artists made for the film. I highly recommend staying and staring at all of the eye candy; our look and modeling departments are filled with some of the most dedicated and talented folks I've ever met. The props in the credits have simply preposterous amounts of detail on them; every single prop has stuff like tiny little flyaway fibers or microscratches or imperfections or whatnot on them. In some of the international posters, one can see that all of the human characters are covered with fine peach fuzz (an important part of making their skin catch the sunlight correctly), which we rendered in every frame! Something that we're really proud of is the fact that _none of the credit props were specially modeled for the credits_! Those are all the exact props we used in every frame that they show up in, which really is a testament to both how amazing our artists our and how much work we've put into every part of our technology. The vast majority of production for Moana happened in essentially the 9 months between Zootopia's release in March and October; this timeline becomes even more astonishing given the sheer beauty and craftsmanship in Moana.

Below are a number of stills (in no particular order) from the movie, pulled from trailers and various Disney marketing materials. These stills give just a hint at how beautiful this movie looks; definitely go see it on the biggest screen you can find! (These stills aren't of the highest quality; I'll replace them with higher quality versions once the film is out on Bluray.)

Here is a credits frame with my name that Disney kindly provided! Most of the Hyperion team is grouped under the Rendering/Pipeline/Engineering Services (three separate teams under the same manager) category this time around, although a handful of Hyperion guys show up in an earlier part of the credits instead.
