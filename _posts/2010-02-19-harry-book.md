Over winter break, my friends and I did a Secret Santa gift exchange, and my assignment was [Harry](http://omjii.com/blog/karu/2009/11/13/surprising-harrando-part-1/). I found this crazy book for him called [The Man's Manual](http://www.amazon.com/Mans-Manual-Secrets-Waitress-Hypnosis/dp/1602392412). But of course just giving him the book straight up isn't much fun, so I decided to disguise the book as a thoroughly dull sounding Biology or Chemistry book. The disguise would also have the added bonus of allowing the Man's Manual to blend in with Harry's textbooks. Here's what I cooked up:

I don't even know what Organic Spectroscopy is, but I figured it sounds very important and difficult. I'm kind of proud of the fake publisher I made up (okay, actually stole from Cartalk): "Dewie Cheetem and Howie". Also, the one author "Larking" is from "Liniy Larking", a pseudonym created by scrambling the letters in "Yining Karl Li".

Some pictures of the assembled book and dust jacket before delivery to Harry:
