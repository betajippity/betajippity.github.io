Look! I finally cut together a demoreel!

I'm getting interviewed by PIXAR! Actually, Pixar gets a slightly different version of my reel. The Pixar version simply has no music... they're not very big fans of music in demoreels, apparently. 

Which is why I got off of my lazy bum and finally cut a reel together.

Oh, I have a reel breakdown too! [Check it out here (PDF)](http://yiningkarlli.com/demoreel/spring2011/spring2011_v1.pdf). 

The song in my reel is "I Like Van Halen Because My Sister Says They Are Cool" by El Ten Eleven. I've recut it slightly to fit the length of the reel. 

I also finally put together a personal site thing at [www.yiningkarlli.com](www.yiningkarlli.com). 

Speaking of new sites... I should probably get around to redesigning Omjii.com soon. Hm.
