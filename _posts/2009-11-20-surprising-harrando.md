Remember the comic "[The Story Of Bunbury](http://www.omjii.com/archives/2009/11/04/The_Story_Of_Bunbury)"? Odds are that comic made no sense whatsoever without some context. This story provides that context.

So for Halloween weekend, Mary came back to Philly from PennState! Emma was also planning on going home too. Mary and Emma going home meant that Sarah and I were going home for the weekend too. But what about Harry?

Harry told us he was too busy to go home over the weekend. He would be staying at Swarthmore all weekend.

Obviously, Harry's staying all alone all weekend was unacceptable. Mary, Sarah, Emma and I decided to do the only thing there was to do- if Harry couldn't come see us, we would go see him. We were going to surprise visit Harry.

So early Halloween morning, I set out from Penn for Temple to meet with Mary and Sarah (Mary arrived the night before and stayed with Sarah). We stopped at a food truck at Temple and... found some grape drink! Not grape JUICE, mind you, but grape DRINK. Sugar, water,... and purple. Google the skit.

So Sarah, Mary, and I went on the train to Swarthmore. Which meant we had a lot of time. Commence messing around with cameras!

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0589.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0589.jpg)

While we were on the train, Sarah decided to call Harry.

"Hello? Hi Harry! We're on the train... home!" said Sarah. "Are you in your room right now?"

"I have a volleyball game to go see" replied Harry.

"Aw shoot... we're almost home, so we can videochat with you..."

Smooth cover, Sarah. Guaranteeing Harry would be in his room when we arrived: check.

"It's going to be the best videochat in the world."

This picture shows Sarah and Mary after the phone call. Clearly they are supervillians:

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0600.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0600.jpg)

So we got off at Swarthmore and the first building we could see from the train station was... HARRY'S DORM. TARGET IN SITE. Muahaha. I believe Mary's instant impression of the Swarthmore campus was something like "AAAAAHHHHHH SO PRETTYYYYYYYYYY."

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0602.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0602.jpg)

Suddenly, a white van appeared around the corner and approached the train station! Why, who could this be? Why, none other than Emma, of course!

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0604.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0604.jpg)

So we walk walk walked into Swarthmore along their big tree-lined path thinger. There were a LOT of leaves everywhere.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0613.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0613.jpg)

The whole time as we walked along, we talked about how we were going to go into Harry's dorm and whether or not we should pick a back entrance to avoid the risk of Harry seeing us. Harry's room is on the first floor, so he could have seen us if we walked by his window. The whole time, though, we didn't realize that his dorm building was locked... but that's okay, somebody let us in.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0618.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0618.jpg)

We were in the building! Now onto finding Harry...

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0619.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0619.jpg)

So we're inside Harry's dorm building looking for his room. Sarah remembered that his door had a picture of some historical person with a mustache, so we looked for that, only to discover that historical people with crazy mustaches was their hall theme and EVERY door had a picture of a historical guy with a mustache. But not to worry, who should we run into but a friend of Harry's? So up we go to Harry's door and once we found our hiding spots, our newfound super awesome Swarthmore spy friend knocked.

"Haarrrryyyyyy I wanna go to lunch!"

Perfect. Out pops Harry, and... SURPRISE! Minutes later inside his room, he still had this expression on this face:

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0622.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0622.jpg)

Yes, that's Bruce Lee on his wall.

So we hung around in Harry's dorm building for a while... and witnessed the evolution of the Sarah dance! Sarah's dance now include a dinosaur move.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0626.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0626.jpg)

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0627.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0627.jpg)

Then Harry had to go off to his job. He works in Swarthmore's library. So we followed him, and along the way Mary found her way into this giant, round tree. Apparently Swarthmore fines anybody who climbs or otherwise harms any of the trees on campus since their campus is coextensive with the Scott Arboretum. Arboretums are cool.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0633.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0633.jpg)

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0727.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0727.jpg)

Harry is quite lucky. Swarthmore's library is just a quick walk away from his dorm building, whereas I have to walk a good 10 to 15 minutes just to reach Penn's main library. I'm jealous.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0635.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0635.jpg)

So while Harry did his library work, Emma, Sarah, Mary and I wandered around and explored! The first floor of Swarthmore's library is a "social zone" where talking is allowed. The top floor is an absolute silent floor, as is the basement.

Of course we decided to go be rowdy and explore on the top floor and basement.

We found something mad neat on one of the floors: bound volumes of newspapers. Now I really want to learn how to bind books so I can make a giant book of Daily Pennsylvanians or something.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0647.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0647.jpg)

Emma's version of heaven probably looks something like this place.

So where does the Story of Bunbury come in? What happens when a bunch of college kids find gigantic beach chairs? We shall see...

So we’re running around the inside of Swarthmore’s library finding the most random things in the world while Harry is doing his cataloguing work.

We found some pretty random things. Libraries are mucho neato.

Here’s a Professor named J. Roland Pennock.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0642.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0642.jpg)

And this is Lord Peter Wimsey.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0656.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0656.jpg)

In the basement level, I found a giant shelve of maps and geological summaries from the United States Geological Survey, and under the section labeled “Pennsylvania- L”, I found this- a map of the area around Lansdale! The topology of home sweet home- circa 1983. Cool.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0674.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0674.jpg)

Here’s Mary reacting to all of the stuff we found:

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0641.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0641.jpg)

Okay, actually, I lied. I have no idea what Mary is reacting to in this picture.

Eventually we found Harry again just as he shifted from cataloging to front desk work. We wound up sticking around the front desk because now that Harry was in a stationery position, we could chat and banter with him. Plus, the first floor of the library is a “social zone”.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0715.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0715.jpg)

Harry obviously likes the front desk better than cataloging.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0717.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0717.jpg)

Eventually, somebody found a guest book! So what does Sarah do but start drawing into the guest book? So we take turns drawing and writing and soon a story begins to take shape in the Swarthmore Library guest book, and before too long, the [The Story Of Bunbury](http://www.omjii.com/archives/2009/11/04/The_Story_Of_Bunbury) is born!

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0721.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0721.jpg)

Here’s Harry with the story:

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0722.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0722.jpg)

Then we went outside… and saw the giant chairs… big chairs all over the placed! Sitting out in the open! Stacked on top of each other! WE NEED TO CLIMB THEM.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0728.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0728.jpg)

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0729.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0729.jpg)

The chairs were kinda soggy on account of rain though. But hey, at least the clouds made for some neat shots… like this one of Emma!

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0731.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0731.jpg)

Some of these chairs looked mad unstable. Oh well, climbing time!

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0734.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0734.jpg)

And then more exploration…

The amazing thing about Swarthmore’s campus is that the campus has soooooo many trees. Which makes for some amazing forest paths and exploratorium opportunities and… one mad crazy insanely cool amphitheater. Fall on the East Coast makes for some pretty photos.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0741.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0741.jpg)

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0746.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0746.jpg)

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0747.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0747.jpg)

As we leave the crazy amphitheater place, we noticed a little path leading into the woods… a path! Well, why would there be a path here unless something interesting was at the other end? So ahead we went, down the slippery leave-strewn path!

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0748.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0748.jpg)

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0749.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0749.jpg)

But the path wound up only leading back to the amphitheater. So instead we went out of the woods and through a scary tunnel…

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0752.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0752.jpg)

To go see Harry play volleyball at the gym!

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0754.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0754.jpg)

Harry is BEASTLY at volleyball. But Mary and Emma were tired…

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0753.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0753.jpg)

But then they woke up again at the end of the day when we all went to get pizza. We got pizza at this place right off campus that makes really greasy, yummy pizza.

[![](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0758.jpg)](/content/images/2009/Nov/DSC_0758.jpg)

Harry’s facial expression reveals his doubts about the pizza- those things were bathing in grease.

And so thus ended our day of surprise (well, at least for Harry) and adventure!

-The End-
