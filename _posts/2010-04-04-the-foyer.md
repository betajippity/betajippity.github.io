For most of March, our Digital Design Foundations assignment was to create a room from an odd perspecitve using Illustrator and Photoshop. Here's what I came up with:

Almost all of this is Illustrator, including the wood, which took ages to do. I loosely based this off of the foyer back at home. My intent with this piece was to practice doing lighting work, and I must say I'm rather happy with it.

I made a quick little video of all the stages this piece went through:

Just for fun, here are some color variations that I made by putting it through Lightroom:

I call this variant the "Coraline" version:
