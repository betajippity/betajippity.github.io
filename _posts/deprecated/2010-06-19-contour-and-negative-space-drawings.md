During the second week of Drawing class, we moved on from [gesture drawings](http://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2010/05/gesture-drawings.html) to contour drawings and negative space drawings.

The idea behind contour drawings is to draw an object as a single unbroken line to create a sort of outline drawing. This series of exercises was supposed to help us better understand forms. Everything we did for contour was pencil on paper or pencil on newsprint.

We started with a bamboo plant kind of thing:

We then moved on to a variation of contour drawing called blind contour drawing. Blind contour drawing works just like normal contour drawing, but you're not allowed to actually look at the paper and pencil. Instead, you stare at the object you are drawing and only look at the paper quickly when you need to reset where your pencil is. The idea behind blind contour drawing is that by removing the distraction of the paper, you can focus more on noticing all of the little details in how each line goes. Needless to say, I found blind contour drawing to be mad difficult.

We started with a cow skull:

Then we moved on to a (fake) human skull:

Next, we did a normal contour drawings with both vertical and horizontal lines meant to express not only the outline of the object, but that sort of wireframe of the object.

I tried a conch shell, without much success. I must admit, I'm not very happy with this drawing:

Later in the week we moved on to a different exercise for practicing seeing form called negative space drawing. In negative space drawing, you put down everything that *isn't* the subject of the drawing and suggest what the subject is through the blank space that remains. We used diluted india ink on paper.

My first attempt with a plant:

...and my second attempt. I didn't actually finish the second one; I may go back and finish it later on:

India ink is mad hard to use. It's also mad dark, so getting it on clothes is really annoying.

More later!
