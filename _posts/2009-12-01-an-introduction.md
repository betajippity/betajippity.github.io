Welcome to Code and Visuals, my blog for tracking my exploration of the world of computer graphics!

This post says December 2009 on it, but it's actually backdated. I'm adding this post backdated in order to serve as a bit of an introduction. This blog began elsewhere but eventually became my computer graphics blog. Upon moving the hosting of this blog to Github Pages, I've decided to clear out some older off-topic posts, although those posts will remain available on the [old Blogger version of this blog](http://yiningkarlli.blogspot.com).

I started this blog around the time I joined Penn's Digital Media Design program in 2009. Most of the older posts on this blog are pretty silly, but hopefully they show that I've made progress since then!
