I really need to get better at drawing and sketching. Because as of now, I'm still rubbish at it.

I've decided to get one of those little pocket-sized-ish sketchbooks. My plan is to carry it everywhere and do a few quick and maybe not so quick sketches a day. Hopefully by the time the sketchbook is full, I'll have gotten a tad better.

Today I got bored in Accounting class and decided to try to sketch my professor as a first exercise. It kind of resembles him, I suppose. I'm not very good at sketching live people.

Penn has this one really cool building called Vance Hall that looks like some kind of high tech sci-fi laboratory. It's actually one of Wharton's buildings with boring Wharton things inside, which is a very not cool way to make use of a very cool building. I thought that building might be fun to sketch.
