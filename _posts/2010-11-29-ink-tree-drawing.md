I have a pretty sizeable backlog of things from the Drawing class I took over the summer, so I'm going to start posting a few things from over the summer each week.

One homework assignment we had was to do an environmental drawing with ink. I did a tree based on a photo I took at Peace Valley Park.

An amusing sidenote: for large format things, I usually depend on decent lighting and my Nikon D60, but this particular drawing was small enough that I decided to try using a large format scanner with it. Even with a giant large format scanner though, I ended up having to scan it in four segments and then stitch the segments in Photoshop. Photoshop is good at auto-stitching!
