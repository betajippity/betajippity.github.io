For our current Digital Design Foundations project, we're doing stuff involving perspective. Here's some perspective sketches I did:

A random box:

...and an Apple Cinema Display:

A series of rooms:

I know, I know, the chair in this one is messed up. Maybe it's a hoverchair that... um... can fly...

And the stairs in this one are weird. I'll get this eventually.
