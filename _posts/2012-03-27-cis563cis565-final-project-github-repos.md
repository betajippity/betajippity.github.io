For both [MultiFluids](http://chocolatefudgesyrup.blogspot.com/) and the [GPU Pathtracer](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/), we will be making our source code accessibly to all on Github!

Of course commercial coding projects and whatnot have very good reasons for keeping their source code locked down and proprietary, but open source is something I very strongly believe in. Open code allows other people to see what one does and give feedback and suggestions for improvement, and also allows other people interested in similar projects to potentially learn and build off of. Everybody wins!

The MultiFluids repository can be found here: [https://github.com/betajippity/MultiFluids](https://github.com/betajippity/MultiFluids)

The GPU Pathtracer repository can be found here: [https://github.com/peterkutz/GPUPathTracer/](https://github.com/peterkutz/GPUPathTracer/)
