Okay, I'm close to finished with the face...

I've decided not to give her eyelashes. They didn't look very good. I also noticed that in some Pixar characters, Pixar chose to keep the lips the same color as the rest of the skin... I kind of like that style choice, so I'm going to steal it (read: Karl is too lazy to paint lips).
