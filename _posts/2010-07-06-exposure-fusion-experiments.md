Recently I've been experimenting with exposure fusion, a new technique that is [sort of like HDR, but not HDR](http://digital-photography-school.com/exposure-fusion-what-is-it-how-does-it-compare-to-hdr-how-do-i-do-it). After a week of experimenting, I've decided I prefer exposure fusion to HDR, mainly because there's no messy tone-mapping involved, which means... less of a chance for people to really screw up the photos. HDR done right looks really good, but when people do HDR for the sake of HDR, things get [overdone really fast](http://www.jmg-galleries.com/blog/2007/08/15/why-i-hate-hdr-photo-technology-porn/).

These were taken through the course of the week throughout the University City area, at various points on the R5 train to Lansdale, and at home. Everything that isn't flowers was shot on my iPhone, everything that is flowers was shot with my Nikon D60.

The Penn Bookstore:

Waiting for the R5 at 30th Street Station:

Some random bushes. Check the geotagged GPS coordinates in the EXIF data (all of these photos are- and all of my photos from now on will be- geotagged) if you care to know where this was taken.

An orchid of some sort. With these shots I added an exposure with flash to the mix of exposures that went into the fusion process.
