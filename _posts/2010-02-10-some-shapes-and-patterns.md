For our Digital Design Foundations class's first project, we've been doing some basic things with shapes and patterns in Illustrator so that students new to Illustrator can get the hang of things. Easy stuff, but kinda fun.

The first thing we had to do was make a shape and use three of that shape to make a bigger shape. I made my little shape interlock with itself:

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/Project1Shape1.png)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/Project1Shape1.png)

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/Project1Shape2.png)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/Project1Shape2.png)

Then we had to cut out a little square or piece from the shapes and use that square or piece to make some black and white patterns. Here's a whole bunch:

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/Project1Studies1.png)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/Project1Studies1.png)

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/Project1Studies2.png)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/Project1Studies2.png)

The final step of the project was to take some of the patterns we made, add a color, and make a gigantic pattern thing:

[![]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/Project1Final.png)]({{site.url}}/content/images/2010/Feb/Project1Final_full.png)

We got to print our final pattern things on gigantic HP Designjet plotters. So now I have a gigantic 6 foot by 6 foot poster of this pattern. Sweet!

Our next project involves drawing celebrities with interesting hair, hence all those random people studies I've been doing. I think this next project is going to be fun.
