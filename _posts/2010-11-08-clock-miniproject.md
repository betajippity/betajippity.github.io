Over the weekend I decided to do a little mini-project to try out some new tricks I've learned with rendering. I decided to try to make as photorealistic of an image as possible of a clock. Here's what I came up with:

The clock face is noticeably pixelated; I'm not entirely sure why that is. For some reason Mental Ray is not sampling the texture file at a very high frequency, I'll work on that next I suppose.

A little breakdown video of the compositing that went into the clock:
