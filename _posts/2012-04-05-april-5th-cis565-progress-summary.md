This post is the second update for the [GPU Pathtracer project](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/)!

Since the last update, Peter and I added an interactive camera to the renderer to allow realtime movement around the scene! We also had our Alpha Review, which went quite well, and Peter implemented a reflection model. Initially the reflection model used was [Schlick's Approximation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlick's_approximation), but later Peter replaced that with the full [Fresnel equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations). I also added super-sampled anti-aliasing for a smoother image.

The posts for this update:

1. [Interactivity and Moveable Camera](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/2012/04/interactivity-and-moveable-camera.html): We can move around the scene!
2. [Alpha Review Presentation](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/2012/04/alpha-review-presentation.html): Slides and other stuff from our Alpha Review
3. [Specular Reflection Test](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/2012/04/specular-reflection-test.html): The first test with Shlick's Approximation
4. [Fresnel Reflections](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/2012/04/fresnel-reflections.html): Some details on our reflection model
5. [Abstract Art](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/2012/04/abstract-art.html): Some fun buggy renders Peter produced while debugging
6. [Anti-Aliasing](http://gpupathtracer.blogspot.com/2012/04/anti-aliasing.html): Super-sampled anti-aliasing!
