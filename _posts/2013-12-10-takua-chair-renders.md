A while back, I did some test renders with Takua a0.4 to test out the material system. The test model was a model of an Eames Lounge Chair Wood, and the materials were glossy wood and aluminum. Each render was done with a single large, importance sampled area light and took about two minutes to complete.

These renders were the last tests I did with Takua a0.4 before starting the new version. More on that soon!
