My CIS121 professor. We call him Kostas, which is short for Konstantinos. We were talking about using binary trees to compress data.

I was in the main Mac lab at Addams hall and I saw this guy reaching for his coffee, but he spent probably 5 entire minutes just sort of waving his hand around since the coffee was just out of reach. For some reason he didn't bother to lean over the entire time.
